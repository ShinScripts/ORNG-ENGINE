18/3/23:
-Changed ECS to using contiguous memory for performance, this makes creating entities slower but rendering them faster
-SceneEntity class that all scene components derive from to allow entities to have structures with eachother
-Mesh entities with the same mesh data can now properly support different shader types
-ID system for entities

14/3/23:
-Shadow support for spotlights

13/3/23:
-Reflective shader that reflects skybox
-Skybox optimizations
-More lighting model fixes/changes, reflected light always less than light received, shadow bias depends on slope

12/3/23:
-Directional light controls
-Depth map viewing window
-Changes to shadow map biasing (still not perfect)
-WorldTransform2D added to support 2D entities and windows

11/3/23:
-Changes to Blinn-Phong lighting algorithm to fix ambient lighting issues
-Rough shadow mapping implemented
-Display now drawn to as a textured quad
-Shaders restructured to remove repeated code


9/3/23:
-Switched to UBOs for lights (~30% increased perfomance)
-Switched to UBOs for view/projection matrices.
-Scene entities can now be edited before being loaded


7/3/23:
-Added spotlights with a visualization cone angled with the cameras target vector (needs some work)
-Fixed world matrix bug caused by incorrect multiplication order
-Fixed flat colour shader WVP uniform bug caused by WVP being taken from light instead of its mesh visual


5/3/23:
-Added fixed distance limits for point lights
-Improved multi-shader support for scenes
-Removed render functionality from BasicMesh class
-Added draw call functions to Renderer 
-Fixed black texture issue caused by bad materials
