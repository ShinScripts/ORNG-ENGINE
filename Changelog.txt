-Switched to deferred rendering pipeline
-Modular materials, can be changed on meshes now
-More transform buffer optimizations, moved to ssbos, ~5x increased performance on many moving objects
-Fixed dreadful activateprogram function which was re-linking the program every time it was called (400 to 1400fps in some areas)


24/4/23:
-Basic Entity editor
-Very underdeveloped asset viewer/editor
-ECS improvements
-Entity selection through mouse picking
-Native scripting
-Rewrote shader, shaderlibrary, framebuffer and framebufferlibrary apis to make them actually usable
-AABB generation for meshes
-Texture generation more customizable
-Lighting shader optimizations (reduced branching)
-Optimizations to transform buffer code, moving components much faster
-CMake integration
-Linked most dependencies as submodules, every library also now static
-Reduced build times with precompiled headers
-Other things

9/4/23:
-Terrain texture blending
-Quadtree based dynamic terrain LOD
-Asynchronous terrain chunk loading system
-Frustum culling for terrain
-Optimizations to reduce build times
-Fixed lighting bug caused by calculating lighting only in tangent space without normal maps provided

01/4/23:
-Very basic layer system added (currently only an editor layer)


30/3/23:
-Fog method (https://cs.gmu.edu/~jchen/cs662/fog.pdf) implemented
-Normal mapping added
-Multiple camera support
-Better logging using spdlog
-Further improvements/changes to codebase structure

23/3/23:
-Procedural terrain generation using perlin noise
-General refactoring, structural changes to codebase
-Timestep has more functionality, supports different units
-Switched ECS back to pointer system, easier to work with

26/3/23:
-Basic non-procedural terrain generation, a few modifiable parameters
-Added auto-generated mipmaps to textures (this also fixes some black texture bugs)

25/3/23:
-Fixed shadow flickering bug when directional light was moved caused by updating the depth map too late

22/3/23:
Fixed diffuse colour bug caused by reading the specular colour instead of the diffuse colour from materials

19/3/23:
-Split spotlight and directional light textures and framebuffers for more performant resolutions for different light types
-PCF shadow softening
-Added scene debug data GUI window
-Fixed memory crash caused by referencing deleted mesh components

18/3/23:
-Changed ECS to using contiguous memory for performance, this makes creating entities slower but rendering them faster
-SceneEntity class that all scene components derive from to allow entities to have structures with eachother
-Mesh entities with the same mesh data can now properly support different shader types
-ID system for entities
-Lowered resolution of depth maps for spotlights

14/3/23:
-Shadow support for spotlights

13/3/23:
-Reflective shader that reflects skybox
-Skybox optimizations
-More lighting model fixes/changes, reflected light always less than light received, shadow bias depends on slope

12/3/23:
-Directional light controls
-Depth map viewing window
-Changes to shadow map biasing (still not perfect)
-WorldTransform2D added to support 2D entities and windows

11/3/23:
-Changes to Blinn-Phong lighting algorithm to fix ambient lighting issues
-Rough shadow mapping implemented
-Display now drawn to as a textured quad
-Shaders restructured to remove repeated code


9/3/23:
-Switched to UBOs for lights (~30% increased perfomance)
-Switched to UBOs for view/projection matrices.
-Scene entities can now be edited before being loaded


7/3/23:
-Added spotlights with a visualization cone angled with the cameras target vector (needs some work)
-Fixed world matrix bug caused by incorrect multiplication order
-Fixed flat colour shader WVP uniform bug caused by WVP being taken from light instead of its mesh visual


5/3/23:
-Added fixed distance limits for point lights
-Improved multi-shader support for scenes
-Removed render functionality from BasicMesh class
-Added draw call functions to Renderer 
-Fixed black texture issue caused by bad materials
